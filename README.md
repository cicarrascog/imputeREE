Impute Missing Rare Earth Element Data Using a Lattice-Strain Derived
Method

Set of functions to impute missing rare earth data, calculate La and Pr
concentrations and Ce anomalies in zircons based on the Chondrite-Onuma
and Chondrite-Lattice of [Carrasco-Godoy and Campbell
(2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00410-023-02025-9) and the Logarithmic
regression from [Zhong et
al. (2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00710-019-00682-y).
